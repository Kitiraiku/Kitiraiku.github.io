About: A p5.js tropical cyclone simulation game
Based on and off Cyclone Sim v0.3.6 (2020-12-26) by MonsoonJr99, all credits go to him

v0.5.0a
+ Improving vulnearbility of storms
+ Tweaking Moisture, Jetstream, Upper Level and Lower Level Patterns
+ Tweaking Steering

v0.4.1

+ Steering Tweaks
+ Minor strengthening of the effects of shear
+ Fixed EX spawns (my "ifJetstreamBound" function had wrong "bracketing")
+ Spawn rates altered

v0.4:

+ Newer storm algorithm
+ Removed Experimental Mode and added Development on Drugs Mode
+ Upper and lower level steering (and resulting shear) changes
+ Minor other changes

v0.3.0d:

+ Now based off v0.3.6 (2020-12-26) Cyclone Sim by MonsoonJr99

v0.3.0c:

+ Now based off v0.3.5 (2020-12-25) Cyclone Sim by MonsoonJr99

v0.3.0b:

+ Copypasted desperately needed UI improvements which MonsoonJr99 implemented in his original sim

v0.3.0:

+ Improved algorithm, stronger storms don't need that much of high SSTs anymore if other conditions are right
+ Changed spawnrates
+ Tweaked moisture, steering and climate

v0.2.2:

+ Improved algorithm ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

v0.2.1e Exp. :
v0.2.1d Exp. :

+ Read previous

v0.2.1c Experimental:

+ Fixing the algorithm and improving it

v0.2.1b: 

+ Debuffed moisture

v0.2.1: Surprising change:

+ Improved storm algorithm

The steering will be the main focus unless something gets unveiled about the storm algorithm (and it did!)

v0.2.0: Many changes:

+ Much tweaking on steering (influencing the shear of course) and some on moisture
+ Improved storm algorithm
+ Some other changes

v0.1.1: Some changes:
+ Tweaked spawn rates and location, and added a function which allows non-tropical lows to form deeper down, and lows can form off-season now
+ Minimally tweaked climate, SSTs and SST-Anomalies
+ Enhanced the algorithm with constrains

v0.1.0: Replaced Normal with Semi-Realisic, aiming at less excessive dependence on sea surface temperatures from the Storm algorithm, which
is modified here, including some random EWRCs. Also took many sea suface temperature anomalies and steering settings from Magicdrizzles fork.
